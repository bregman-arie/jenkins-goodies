// Best practice is to actually call this file 'Jenkinsfile'
// I named it 'basic_pipeline' just to explain its purpose

// Pipeline is written in Pipeline DSL syntax

pipeline {

    // Jenkins to allocate workspace and executor
    agent any

    // Stages are block of code you execute through your build
    stages {

    // This is the first stage the pipeline will execute
    // A stage execute specific step of your flow
        stage('Build') {
            // Steps to be executed as part of the 'Build' stage
            steps {
                sh 'echo "Building"' // Execute the 'echo' shell command
            }
        }

    // Once previous stage finished successfully, Jenkins will 
    // execute this stage.
        stage('Test'){
            steps {
                sh 'echo "Testing"'
                // To publish test results add this: junit 'reports/**/*.xml'
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'echo "Deploying"'
            }
        }
    }

} // End of the pipeline
